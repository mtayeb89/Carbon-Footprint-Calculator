# Carbon Footprint Calculator

## Overview

This Carbon Footprint Calculator is a simple Python application designed to help users estimate their monthly and yearly carbon footprint. By inputting data about their energy consumption and travel habits, users can get an idea of their environmental impact and receive tips on how to reduce it.

## Features

- Calculates carbon footprint based on:
  - Electricity usage
  - Natural gas usage
  - Oil usage
  - Car travel distance
  - Flight hours
- Provides both monthly and yearly estimates
- Compares user's footprint to the global average
- Offers tips for reducing carbon footprint

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `carbon_footprint_calculator.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `carbon_footprint_calculator.py`.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```
   python carbon_footprint_calculator.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your usage data.
5. Review your calculated carbon footprint and the provided tips.

## Sample Output

```
Welcome to the Carbon Footprint Calculator!
Please enter your monthly usage for the following:
Electricity usage (in kWh): 300
Natural gas usage (in m3): 50
Oil usage (in liters): 0
Car travel distance (in km): 500
Flight hours: 2

Your estimated monthly carbon footprint is 654.00 kg CO2.
Your estimated yearly carbon footprint is 7848.00 kg CO2.
Your carbon footprint is above the global average. Consider ways to reduce your impact.

Tips to reduce your carbon footprint:
1. Use energy-efficient appliances
2. Reduce car usage and consider public transportation
3. Minimize air travel
4. Use renewable energy sources
5. Reduce, reuse, and recycle
```

## Limitations

- This calculator uses simplified conversion factors and may not account for regional variations in energy production and consumption.
- The global average used for comparison is approximate and may not reflect the most current data.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed categories (e.g., different types of transportation, food consumption)
- Implement data persistence to track changes over time
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use
- Add more detailed tips based on the user's specific high-impact areas
